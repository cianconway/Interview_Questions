# JavaScript

### console.log()
<script>
var a = 40;
</script>
console.log(a)

If you open the debuger tool and select console you should see cthe value of a in the log. (40 in this case)

### Difference between == and ===
Null and Undefined types are == (but not ===). [I.e. (Null==Undefined) is true but (Null===Undefined) is false]
